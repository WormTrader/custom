# Custom

The package `com.wormtrader.custom` holds custom code
 used by the WormTrader applications to tailor it to
 a particular user's trading style or to build complete
 trading systems.

The problem with this implementation is that the trader must be
 a java programmer in order to create new systems to run on the
 WormTrader engine. See work in progress in `com.wormtrader.custom` for rectifying
 this shortcoming.

The package `com.wormtrader.custom.worms` contains numerous trading systems,
 which we call *worms*, built to run on the WormTrader engine.
